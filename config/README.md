## Centralized Configuration Service

Horizontally scalable centralized configuration service for distributed systems. It provides a central place to manage external properties for all services.

In a real-world system, the number of services can rapidly grow; having hundreds of them is not uncommon. Having to configure each service individually might not be feasable.

## Test
`curl http://user:foo@localhost:8888/api-gateway/default`
